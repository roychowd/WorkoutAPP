# WorkoutU

An app built for the students of University of Alberta.
This app uses postgreSQL to hold data regarding exercises, and nutrition information which is connected to our api (see Workout-api) for more details.

In order to start the project, first make a copy of both repositories (Workout-api & WorkoutAPP) and run **npm start** on both.

From here you can create an account and interact with it yourself.

PLEASE NOTE THAT THIS APP IS UNFINISHED: <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;finish the modals dialogs to add workout to workout plan
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;set up meal planner page<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;connect api to meal planner
